                      Of course we don't do that in plain text, because then everybody would be able to steal your passwords.
                      The only way to see your passwords is to decrypt them with your wallet.

                    Metamask allows you to inspect the decrypted message before you pass it on to Chainlock.
                    It looks like gibberish but it is the <b>really important secret</b> that Chainlock needs
                    to manage your passwords. As a matter of fact, anyone with that secret can freely access
                    your passwords, so it is very important that you never share, copy, screenshot or record it.
                    Contrary to your recovery phrase, you don't need to back up the secret because Chainlock
                    stores it on-chain (encrypted by your wallet).

                  <p className="py-2 px-3 text-gray-600">
                    Definitely no. Metamask never shares your seed phrase, recorvery phrase or private key with anyone, including us.
                    We ask Metamask to encrypt/decrypt your passwords with your wallet key pair,
                    but it is impossible for us to access your private key.

                  <p className="py-2 px-3 text-gray-900">
                    Prevent that at all costs. You'll lose all your coins, tokens, NFTs... in your wallet.
                    You will also lose access to all the passwords in your Chainlock vault(s).
